# mf_character_sheet
Roll20 sheet worker based character sheet for Millennium Freelancers RPG. HTML, Sheet Workers JS and CSS.

THIS IS CURRENTLY A WIP WITH SEVERAL KNOWN ISSUES

To be used on roll20.net with the custom character sheet feature, which requires pro subscription. Once finished I'll look for a way to publish it in a way that's accessible to everybody.
To use copy the HTML and insert it into the HTML section of the custom character sheet text box. Then copy the JS and paste it between the <script type="worker"> and </script> tags.
Finally switch to the CSS Styling tab, copy and paste the CSS and click the Save Changes button.

You can contact me at zoliking@freemail.hu if you find any issues with the character sheet.
